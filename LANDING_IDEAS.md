Quick reference for making the landing feel premium and on-brand.

## ✅ Implemented (this round)

- **Staggered hero** — Name, handle, tagline, and promise animate in with slight delays.
- **Standout promise line** — “The good stuff” in larger gradient text.
- **Soft hero background** — Decorative gradient blobs for depth.
- **Testimonial block** — One fan quote for social proof (edit the quote in `index.html`).
- **Wavy section divider** — Between hero and perks.
- **Pricing card** — “Join the circle” ribbon, soft glow, trust badges.
- **Preview cards** — Staggered reveal + stronger hover lift.
- **Primary button** — Subtle shine on hover.
- **Trust line** — Lock + check icons next to “Secure payment · Cancel anytime”.

1. **Animated gradient mesh** — Very slow-moving background gradient (CSS or small canvas).
2. **Perk icons** — Small custom icons or emoji per bullet (heart, star, sparkle, chat).

4. **“X people in the circle”** — Optional live count from Firestore (if you want to show member count).
5. **Instagram embed or badge** — “Follow @stormij_xo” pill with IG-style look.
6. **Limited spots / urgency** — “Only 50 spots this month” (static or from Firestore).
7. **Glass header** — Slight blur on scroll (backdrop-filter).
8. **Preview “lock” overlay** — Subtle lock icon on preview cards until they scroll (exclusive feel).
9. **Confetti or sparkle** on CTA click (optional, playful).
