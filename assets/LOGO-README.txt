To use a new logo (e.g. with transparent background):

1. Save or copy the new image into this folder as logo.png
   (replace the existing logo.png).

2. From the project root run:
   npm run logo-transparent

   Or with a specific file path:
   node scripts/make-logo-transparent.js path/to/your-new-logo.png

This makes any black/dark background transparent so only the pink
"Inner Circle" text shows on your site.
